This project is a part of a student thesis done at Blekinge Institute of Technology, testing two open source chatbots and their NLPs.

## Prerequisites

To use this chatbot, you first need to download the Botpress software. Follow the [Botpress download guide](https://botpress.com/download) to do this.

## Download chatbot repo

```
git clone https://github.com/lioo19/chatbotThesis
```

The files in this repository should be placed in the ```data/bots```-folder to work properly. The chatbot should then pop up in your visual conversation studio.

## Commands for starting the framework
Start the software by using the following command:
```
./bp
```

When in the visual conversation studio, train the chatbot by pressing the grey button in the bottom right corner. All tests can then be done in the graphical interface, with the help of the debug console.
